Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.
Total net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020.
The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.
Note 3 – Earnings Per Share
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):

Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each.
Fiscal Year Highlights
The Company’s total net sales were $383.3 billion and net income was $97.0 billion during 2023.
The Company’s total net sales decreased 3% or $11.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022. The weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar accounted for more than the entire year-over-year decrease in total net sales, which consisted primarily of lower net sales of Mac and iPhone, partially offset by higher net sales of Services.

(1)
Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.
(2)
Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services bundled in the sales price of certain products.
iPhone
iPhone net sales decreased 2% or $4.9 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due to lower net sales of non-Pro iPhone models, partially offset by higher net sales of Pro iPhone models.
Mac
Mac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops.
iPad
iPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation.

Stock Ticker: AAPL

After conducting a search on the internet for news related to Apple, I found a few articles that are not directly related to the company. The first article discusses a mysterious object spotted over Oklahoma City, the second one is about the opening of a gallery in Wilton, CT, the third article talks about an Israeli College canceling a conference on the Israel-Palestine conflict, and the last article seems to have a formatting issue as it displays [object Object].

I will need to conduct further searches to gather relevant news and information related to Apple and its industry to provide a comprehensive summary of the latest news, market sentiment shifts, and potential impacts on the stock.

The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net sales.
Note 3 – Earnings Per Share
The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for 2023, 2022 and 2021 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):

Fiscal Period
The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023.

(1)
Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective product.
(2)

Mac
Mac net sales decreased 27% or $10.8 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of laptops.
iPad
iPad net sales decreased 3% or $1.0 billion during 2023 compared to 2022 due primarily to lower net sales of iPad mini and iPad Air, partially offset by the combined net sales of iPad 9th and 10th generation.

Final Answer: After analyzing Apple Inc.'s latest 10-K form, we can see that the company's total net sales for the fiscal year 2023 were $383.3 billion with a net income of $97.0 billion. The total net sales decreased by 3% compared to the previous year, primarily due to weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and lower net sales of Mac and iPhone.

Specifically, iPhone net sales decreased by 2%, Mac net sales decreased by 27%, iPad net sales decreased by 3%, and Wearables, Home, and Accessories net sales were not mentioned in the provided data.

Apple Inc.'s earnings per share for the fiscal year 2023 were $6.16 (basic) and $6.13 (diluted). The company's financial standing appears strong with consistent profitability and a high gross margin. However, the decrease in total net sales raises some concerns about the company's growth prospects.

In comparison to its industry peers, Apple Inc. continues to be a market leader in terms of revenue and innovation. The company's strengths lie in its brand loyalty, ecosystem of products and services, and strong financial performance. However, weaknesses such as overreliance on iPhone sales and potential market saturation should be considered.

Overall, Apple Inc. remains a solid investment choice with a strong financial foundation, but investors should monitor market trends and competition closely to make informed decisions.

The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.” When any one or more of these risks materialize from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially and adversely affected. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Company’s risk factors since the 2023 Form 10-K.
The technology industry, including, in some instances, the Company, is subject to intense media, political and regulatory scrutiny, which exposes the Company to increasing regulation, government investigations, legal actions and penalties.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
There have been no material changes to the Company’s market risk during the first three months of 2024. For a discussion of the Company’s exposure to market risk, refer to the Company’s market risk disclosures set forth in Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of the 2023 Form 10-K.
Item 4.    Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of the 2023 Form 10-K describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Other Legal Proceedings
The Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the first quarter of 2024 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.
